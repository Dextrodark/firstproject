            <p>Climate (if any) is the only serious deterrent which might spoil your travel plans to Ooty. But regarding climate too, Ooty has something different to offer all throughout the year. The summer is perhaps the best time to visit the place, if you are planning to visit all the tourist spots, including some adventurous treks and hand gliding.</p>
            <p>The summer season is perhaps the best time to visit Ooty hill station. With the average temperature ranging around 25Â°C, days can be a little hot though, especially during the afternoon. But at other times, the heat is bearable. The occasional rains also sweep away some heat to keep Ooty enjoyable. And it even gets cold enough at night for you to put on some warm clothes.</p>
